# TechPlugin(Modular Build System) for Mechanical Assemblies

The **Modular Build System** plugin for Unreal Engine allows users to create dynamic, customizable mechanical assemblies with ease. Build fully functional vehicles, machinery, or complex mechanical systems while maintaining realistic physical behaviors. This plugin integrates seamlessly with Unreal Engine's physics systems, empowering creators to prototype, test, and innovate.

## Features

1. **Free Camera Tracking**  
   Move and drag modules with ease, similar to Siege, for precise placement and testing.
   
2. **Automatic Module Construction**  
   A single function to automatically build connections between modules, including necessary physics constraints.
   
3. **Mechanical Components**  
   Includes a wide variety of components such as engines, gearboxes, differentials, drive shafts, vertical drives, and more.

4. **Auto Wheels**  
   Automatically calculate rotation angles and movement direction based on wheel position and the vehicle's center of mass.

5. **Variety of Modules**  
   A diverse range of modules for constructing various types of mechanical systems, including vehicles and machinery.
